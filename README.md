# MLprojects

Hello Everyone..

My name is Ajay Anand.
This project is a Recommendation system for movies, we have a data set of movies which contains around 5000 movie titles, their respective cast, director, genre and many more details regarding that movie.
we have imported required modules in this such as pandas, TfidVectorizer, difflib, cosine_similarities..

Let me just give you a brief idea..
TfidVectorizer will be transforming the text into the numerical.
difflib will help in finding the close match.
cosine_similarities will help in getting the similar matches.
The movies with the most similarities will be displayed(recommended)
